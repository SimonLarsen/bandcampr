bandcampr is an R package for scraping data from bandcamp.com.

Bandcamp has stopped providing keys for their developer API. In order to get info on albums, fan collections, etc. we instead have to scrape it from their website and the API powering it.

## Installation

Install the latest development version of bandcampr using devtools:

```r
devtools::install_github("SimonLarsen/bandcampr")
```
